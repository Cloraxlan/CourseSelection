One of the largest and fastest growing industries of the 21st century, sports and entertainment marketing provides a unique way to look at the business world. Students will focus on two areas: 1) the marketing of sports and entertainment events, and 2) the marketing of nonsports products and services through these types of events. Using an active and hands-on approach, students will discover why companies pay to be associated with a team or entertainer, how to develop ticket plans to fill arenas, and why target marketing and taking a customer approach leads to success."
